> **From:** Trent Slade  
> **To:** Dr Melvin Vopson  
> **Subject:** Linking Infodynamics to Bianconi’s Entropic Gravity Action  
>  
> “Your work’s emphasis on ∂S_Info / ∂t ≤ 0 as an optimization principle got me connecting dots to Ginestra Bianconi’s *Gravity from Entropy* (Phys. Rev. D, 2025).  
> Her action minimizes information mismatch between spacetime and matter metrics, framing gravity as error correction — entropy gradients driving attraction, with information compression as the trigger.”

> “Relative entropy S(ρ ‖ σ) = −S(ρ) − Tr(ρ log σ).  
> At low coupling, it reduces to standard GR with Λ ≈ 0; finite coupling yields a small emergent Λ.  
> Relative entropy ≈ 0.00356 — a measurable information gradient.”

> “Thank you very much for your email and welcome to IPI.  
> I was not aware of this work on gravity, but I would recommend another article on the same topic, published by me in April 2025.  
> My work is simpler to follow, and it relates directly to the simulation theory, framing gravity as a data-compression mechanism.

> I’m not sure I understand the question?”
