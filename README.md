## Overview

This suite implements theoretical frameworks connecting information theory to fundamental physics:

1. Quantum Information Theory ( `quantum_information.py` )

  * Von Neumann entropy and quantum entanglement
  * Density matrix operations
  * Bell states and quantum correlations
2. Mass-Energy-Information Equivalence ( `mass_energy_equivalence.py` )

  * Vopson's information mass principle (m = N Ã— m_bit)
  * Landauer's principle and thermodynamics
  * Holographic bounds and black hole entropy
3. Ternary Logic & E8 Lattice ( `ternary_e8_logic.py` )

  * Three-valued logic systems
  * E8 root system (240 roots in 8D)
  * Information geometry applications
4. Entropic Gravity ( `entropic_gravity.py` )

  * Verlinde's emergent gravity framework
  * Holographic screens and information
  * Dark energy predictions
5. Visualizations ( `visualizations.py` )

  * NumPy and matplotlib-based plotting
  * Comprehensive visualization suite
  * Publication-quality figures
6. Quantum Error Correction ( `qec_test.py` )

  * Trinary (qutrit) repetition code
  * Majority voting for error correction
  * Demonstrations and statistical analysis

### Critiques of Entropic Gravity (Hossenfelder)
This framework primarily builds on Verlinde's entropic gravity but acknowledges critiques, such as those from Sabine Hossenfelder, who has argued that entropic gravity faces challenges in explaining certain phenomena like neutron interference and gravitational bound states. Her work emphasizes the need for rigorous testing and highlights potential inconsistencies with established physics. For balance, consider her analyses when extending the models here.
